# React + Vite

## About the Project

This website can be used to play various card games. The website will display the available card games, and users will be able to register, login, and like their preferred card games for easier access.

## Technologies Used

HTML, CSS, and JavaScript were used to create the website, and Vite was used for the project template. The project was split into different components using React.
To get the cards and decks, deckofcardsapi.com is used.

## Requirements

For components to interact and work correctly, React is required.

Windows:
React can be downloaded using npm.

npm install react-router-dom@6

## Future Improvements

Currently the program does not allow users to create their own profiles, and the games do not work yet. These will be added in the future, so be sure the check back for any updates!
